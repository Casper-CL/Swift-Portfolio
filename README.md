## Introduction
These projects are a combination of school and freetime projects. I have obviously chosen the ones that are worth sharing. Valuable projects do not necessarily mean complex code and advanced project builds but can also lie in simple coding and structure.

Creating this portfolio, I challenged myself to share what I've been working on. I believe sharing is a way to improve and "finish" projects.

## Projects

### Project 1: SuperHeroAPI

Description: This projekt demonstrates both navigation but also retrieving information from an API and converting that into something user-friendly.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode, JSON

Link: [SuperHeroAPI](SuperHeroAPI)

Results/Learning Bulletpoints: 
- Succesfully received data from an external API.
- Learn how to pass and decode JSON in Swift.
- Implemented user-friendly presentation of retrieved information using SwiftUI.
- Expanded understanding of asynchronous programming concepts in Swift when fetching data from the API.

### Project 2: FormDemo

Description: This project demonstrates navigation in an application using enums instead of NavigationPath. This allows for dynamic and customizable navigation possibilities.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

Link: [FormDemo](FormDemo)

Results/Learning Bulletpoints: 
- Learned how to implement dynamic navigation using enums.
- Explored the advantages of customizable navigation in applications.
- Discovered the flexibility of enums in managing navigation options.
- By creating this project, I also challenge myself designing UI. Trying to create an application with the same UI-style all the way through. Even though it's simple and not very complex, it represents simple and beautiful style. 

### Project 3: GameOfThronesAPI

Description: This project fetches data from an API in JSON format and builds an app around it, showcasing the use of threads in SwiftUI for asynchronous data fetching.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

Link: [GameOfThronesAPI](GameOfThronesAPI)

Results/Learning Bulletpoints: 
- Acquired proficiency in making HTTP requests to external APIs and parsing JSON responses within a Swift application.
- Gained understanding of how to handle asynchronous operations using threads in SwiftUI, ensuring a smooth user experience while data is being fetched in the background.
- Improved skills in structuring and organizing SwiftUI code to effectively display fetched data in a user-friendly interface.

### Project 4: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Description: This project was one of my first projects, demonstrating some of the basic fundamentals in SwiftUI.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

Link: [RockPaperScissors](RockPaperScissors)

Results/Learning Bulletpoints: 
- Learned some of the basics of SwiftUI.
- Implemented game logic for Rock, Paper, Scissors, including user input handling and random opponent selection.
- Explored techniques for designing a simple yet intuitive user interface for the game.
