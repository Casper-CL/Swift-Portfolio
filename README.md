## Introduction
These projects are a combination of school and freetime projects. I have obviously chosen the ones that are worth sharing. Valuable projects do not necessarily mean complex code and advanced project builds but can also lie in simple coding and structure.

Creating this portfolio, I challenged myself to share what I've been working on. I believe sharing is a way to improve and "finish" projects.

## Projects

### Project 1: FormDemo

Description: This project demonstrates navigation in an application using enums instead of NavigationPath. This allows for dynamic and customizable navigation possibilities.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

Link: [FormDemo](FormDemo)

Results/Learning Bulletpoints: 
- Learned how to implement dynamic navigation using enums.
- Explored the advantages of customizable navigation in applications.
- Discovered the flexibility of enums in managing navigation options.
- By creating this project, I also challenge myself designing UI. Trying to create an application with the same UI-style all the way through. Even though it's simple and not very complex, it represents simple and beautiful style. 

### Project 2: GameOfThronesAPI

Description: This project fetches data from an API in JSON format and builds an app around it, showcasing the use of threads in SwiftUI for asynchronous data fetching.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

Link: [GameOfThronesAPI](GameOfThronesAPI)

Results/Learning Bulletpoints: 
- Acquired proficiency in making HTTP requests to external APIs and parsing JSON responses within a Swift application.
- Gained understanding of how to handle asynchronous operations using threads in SwiftUI, ensuring a smooth user experience while data is being fetched in the background.
- Improved skills in structuring and organizing SwiftUI code to effectively display fetched data in a user-friendly interface.

### Project 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Description: This project was one of my first projects, demonstrating some of the basic fundamentals in SwiftUI.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

Link: [RockPaperScissors](RockPaperScissors)

Results/Learning Bulletpoints: 
- Learned some of the basics of SwiftUI.
- Implemented game logic for Rock, Paper, Scissors, including user input handling and random opponent selection.
- Explored techniques for designing a simple yet intuitive user interface for the game.

## Conclusion
If you have read this far by now, I want to say thank you for taking your time to read about my projects, it is greatly appreciated.
