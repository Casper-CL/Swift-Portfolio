## Introduction
These projects are a combination of school and freetime projects. I have obviously chosen the ones who are worth sharing. Valuable project does not mean complex code and advanced project builds but can also lie in simple coding- and structure.

Creating this portfolio i challenged myself to share what i've been working on. I believe sharing is a way to improve and "finish" projects. 

## Projects

### Project 1: FormDemo

Description: This project is about demonstrating navigation in an application. Instead of using NavigationPath i used enums to navigate through the application. This allows users to navigate dynamicly and more freely. This way, navigation becomes customizable and unlimittet navigation possibilities.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

Link: [FormDemo](FormDemo)

Results/learning bulletpoints: 
- Learned how to implement dynamic navigation using enums.
- Explored the advantages of customizable navigation in applications.
- Discovered the flexibility of enums in managing navigation options.
- By creating this project, I also challenge myself designing UI. Trying to create an application with the same UI-style all the way through. Even though it's simple and not very complex, it represents simple and beautiful style. 

### Project 2: GameOfThronesAPI

Description: This project is about demonstrating how to fetch data from an API in json format and using to build an app around it. By doing so, I also showed how to use threads in swiftUI to create an async fetch on the data. 

Teknologier: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode
Link: [GameOfThronesAPI](GameOfThronesAPI)

Results/learning bulletpoints: 
- Acquired proficiency in making HTTP requests to external APIs and parsing JSON responses within a Swift application.
- Gained understanding of how to handle asynchronous operations using threads in SwiftUI, ensuring a smooth user experience while data is being fetched in the background.
- Improved skills in structuring and organizing SwiftUI code to effectively display fetched data in a user-friendly interface.

### Project 3: Rock, Paper, Scissors

Description: This project was one of my first projects, and what better way to make one of your first projects a little game. This demonstrates how you can make simple boring games in swiftUI. 

Teknologier: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode
Link: [RockPaperScissors](RockPaperScissors)

Results/learning bulletpoints: 
- Learned some of the basics of SwiftUI.
- Implemented game logic for Rock, Paper, Scissors, including user input handling and random opponent selection.
- Explored techniques for designing a simple yet intuitive user interface for the game.

## Conclusion
If you have read this far by now, I want to say thank you for taking your time to read about my projects, it is appreciated a lot.
