## Introduction
These projects are a combination of school and freetime projects. I have obviously chosen the ones who are worth sharing. Valuable project does not mean complex code and advanced project builds but can also lie in simple coding- and structure.

Creating this portfolio i challenged myself to share what i've been working on. I believe sharing is a way to improve and "finish" projects. 

## Projects

### Project 1: FormDemo

Description: This project is about demonstrating navigation in an application. Instead of using NavigationPath i used enums to navigate through the application. This allows users to navigate dynamicly and more freely. This way, navigation becomes customizable and unlimittet navigation possibilities.

Technologies: Swift, SwiftUI, Xcode

Link: [FormDemo](FormDemo)

Results/learning bulletpoints: 
- Learned how to implement dynamic navigation using enums.
- Explored the advantages of customizable navigation in applications.
- Discovered the flexibility of enums in managing navigation options.
- By creating this project, I also challenge myself designing UI. Trying to create an application with the same UI-style alle the way through. Even though it's simple and not very complex, it represents simple and beautiful style.
